## Learnings

While working on this project, I picked up a bunch of cool stuff:

- Got comfortable writing **tests using Jest**
- Built the whole thing using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach
- Practiced a lot of **DOM manipulation**
- Learnt how to use audio files in web app when its needed to add interactivity
- Learned how to organize code using **ES modules** â€” super helpful for bigger projects
- Set up and configured **Webpack**, **ESLint**, **Babel**, and **Prettier** (yes, all of them ðŸ˜…)
- Used both **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout (grid for the boards, flex for layout stuff)
- Managed basic **game state** across turns and events
- Focused on trying to write **clean, readable code** thatâ€™s easy to follow
- Got better at handling events to make the game interactive


It was a solid experience and helped me level up a bunch!
